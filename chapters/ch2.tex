\chapter{$Log_AS$}

$Log_AS$ is a class of many-sorted languages that share a common core of logical symbols and differ in a signature of non logical symbols. In what follows, we identify a sort $\sigma$ with
the set of symbols of sort $\sigma$.

A $Log_AS$ language is a set of terms partitioned into three base syntactic types $\sigma_s$, $\sigma_t$
and $\sigma_I$. Intuitively, $\sigma_s$ is the set of terms denoting states, $\sigma_t$ is the set of terms denoting time points, and $\sigma_I$ is the set ofterms denoting anything else.
